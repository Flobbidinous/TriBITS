TriBITS: Tribal Build, Integrate, and Test System
=================================================

The Tribal Build, Integrate, and Test System (TriBITS) is a framework designed
to handle large software development projects involving multiple independent
development teams and multiple source repositories which is built on top of
the open-source CMake set of tools.  TriBITS also defines a complete software
development, testing, and deployment system supporting processes consistent
with modern agile software development best practices.
